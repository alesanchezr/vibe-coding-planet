## Applies to
- **/memory-bank/social-posts.md**

## Rules
1. Keep posts concise and direct ~350 characters
2. Include a relevant emoji at the beginning of each post
3. Highlight specific technical achievements or milestones
4. End with a brief note about what's coming next
5. Use present tense for current work, future tense for upcoming features
6. Include relevant hashtags (#GameDev, #VibeCoding, etc)
7. Avoid unnecessary adjectives and marketing language
8. Focus on concrete progress rather than plans
9. There can be multiple same datetimes, don't fake them.
10. Give a very small introduction on why this step was done.
11. Give a very small outro on whats next.
12. I'm not the one coding, I tell the AI what to code.
13. Be candid and informal, for example: "i have to make the AI update the rendering engine because its a bit slow"
14. Each post must have a `<slug>` identifier because I may save images under the same <slug>.png name to complement the post text with an image.
