Base rules for Three.js and Cannon.js game development applying to all game files

## Rules
1. All game code should follow ES6+ syntax and modular structure
2. Use consistent naming: 
   - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., GameScene)
   - Variables: camelCase (e.g., playerSpeed)
   - Constants: UPPER_CASE (e.g., GRAVITY)
3. Include JSDoc comments for all major functions and classes
4. Maintain a single game loop using requestAnimationFrame
5. Keep game state management centralized
6. Use error handling for WebGL context and physics initialization

## Example
```javascript
/**
 * Main game class handling initialization and game loop
 */
class Game {
    constructor() {
        this.scene = new THREE.Scene();
        this.physicsWorld = new CANNON.World();
    }
}
```
